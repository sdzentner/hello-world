<h4>TABS</h4>
[tab_wrap titles="GET READY,PACKING,MOVE"]
[tab]Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Only you could make those words cute. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.[/tab]

[tab]I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. I'm generally confused most of the time. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.[/tab]

[tab]You all right, Dexter? I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

Makes me a … scientist. I like seafood. I'm really more an apartment person.[/tab]
