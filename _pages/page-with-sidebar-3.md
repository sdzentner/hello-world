Say what? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Bender?! You stole the atom.
<h2>I, Roommate</h2>
Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You don't know how to do any of those.
<h3>Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles</h3>
Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Belligerent and numerous.
<h4>Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings</h4>
Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! I just told you! You've killed me! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
<h5>The Honking</h5>
Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Why did you bring us here? Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
<h6>A Clone of My Own</h6>
Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. I'm a thing. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Who are you, my warranty?! Bender, we're trying our best. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?

When will that be? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Shut up and take my money!

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Can I use the gun? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!

Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

Shut up and take my money! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? She also liked to shut up!

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

I'll get my kit! With gusto. And then the battle's not so bad? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Moving along…

Soon enough. You're going to do his laundry? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Yeah, lots of people did. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

Tell her she looks thin. They're like sex, except I'm having them! No, she'll probably make me do it. It's toe-tappingly tragic! But existing is basically all I do! No, I'm Santa Claus!

Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his Life. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

Bite my shiny metal ass. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? And when we woke up, we had these bodies.

You wouldn't. Ask anyway! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his Life. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Throw her in the brig.

Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Bender, you risked your Life to save me! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.
